            As you know, my name is Ryan Manfred. I'm a sophomore at Purdue studying Computer Information Technology. Web development is a hobby of mine. My next project is learning python and applying it to this website somehow. Also using python to learn how to script and automate some day to day stuff.

            <h3>Why did I make this website?</h3>
            <p>It's pretty simple. I built it as a side project to get back into web development.  I also wanted to learn how to host my own site on a raspberry pi. It's just a test for me and something to keep me busy and learning.</p>
